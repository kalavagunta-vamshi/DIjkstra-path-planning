# Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation

## Introduction
The Dijkstra Algorithm is a fundamental tool used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Instructions to Run the Code
To run the algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Download the source code file named **dijkstra.py** from the repository's code folder.
2. If you're using a Python IDE, simply click on the run button. 
3. Ensure the following libraries are installed in your system: numpy, cv2, matplotlib, time.
   If any of these libraries are missing, you can install them using the following pip command in your terminal window:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
